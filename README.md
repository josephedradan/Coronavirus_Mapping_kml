# Coronavirus Infected Visualization on Google Maps 
## Based on the Kaggle's Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset's COVID19_open_line_list.csv

https://josephedradan.github.io/Coronavirus_Mapping_kml/

Using the Kaggle's Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) on the COVID19_open_line_list.csv file, map the locations of infected individuals.
I made this because the JohnHopkins (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) map was not very specific and I don't have money for the google cloud platform.

How to use:
1. Download the Kaggle's Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset
2. Place the COVID19_open_line_list.csv file in the same directory as this repository
3. Run Coronavirus_Mapping_kml.py
